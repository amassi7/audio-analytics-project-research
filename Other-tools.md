[Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/sentiment-opinion-mining/overview?tabs=prebuilt)

[Amazon Bedrock Samples](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples)

[Semantic Search for Speeches in Audio GH Research Project](https://github.com/SyedIkram/Semantic-Search-for-speeches-in-Audio)
